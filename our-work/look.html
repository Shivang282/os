            It is a better version of the scan disk scheduling where it considers the requests if it is scanning in the same direction. In fact, it works in the real sense of an elevator. If the elevator picks someone from the 4th floor and if the person needs to be dropped at 5th floor, it will not go till the end and then start from bottom to drop you at 3rd floor. Though it will go till the last requested level, it will drop you on the way back.

        <p><li><b>EXAMPLE : </b>Let say we are given with the following queue ==> 95, 180, 34, 119, 11, 123, 62, 64 with the Read-write head initially at the track 50 and the tail track being at 199 let us now discuss the different algorithms.</li></p>
